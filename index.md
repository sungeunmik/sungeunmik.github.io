Welcome!

I am 1st year Ph.D. Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego, co-advised by Prof. [Mingu Kang](https://ucsdvvip.com/){:target="_blank"} and Prof. [Tajana Rosing](http://varys.ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"}

I recieved my B.E in Electrical Engineering from Korea University. And I worked at SK Hynix as a NAND Flash Logic Designer for 5 and a half year.

My research interest is ML accelerator and in-memory computing.
